# 🌀 Fourier Drawing Approximator

Generate smooth Fourier series approximations from 2D points. Ideal for visualizing outlines of logos, sketches, or drawings using mathematical functions.

## ✏️ Step 1: Collect Points

Use the free online tool:

👉 https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer

1. Upload your image.
2. Select "Manual Mode".
3. Click along the shape or outline you want to trace.
4. Export/download the data as a list of (x, y) points.

---

## 📋 Step 2: Paste Points into Script

Open the Python script and find the following section:

raw_data = """
x1, y1
x2, y2
...
"""

Paste your copied points inside the triple quotes """.

---

## ▶️ Step 3: Run the Script

Run the script using Python:

python your_script_name.py

This will:

- Reorder your points to form a continuous outline.
- Smoothly loop the path for periodicity.
- Plot both the original and Fourier-approximated curve using matplotlib.

---

## 📈 Output

- A matplotlib figure displaying:
  - Dotted original points.
  - Smooth Fourier-approximated path.
- Optional: Copy-paste friendly output for Desmos.

---

## 📌 Example Desmos Output

After running the script, you'll see something like:

📌 COPY AND PASTE INTO DESMOS:
x(t) = ...
y(t) = ...
✅ Then plot (x(t), y(t)) with t in [0, 1]

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

Install dependencies if needed:

pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

---

## ✅ Tip for Better Approximations

- More evenly spaced points = smoother approximation.
- Closed loops are important! Click the end point near the start.
- Try ~300–400 points for detailed shapes.
